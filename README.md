# landing-conflict-demo

A tiny responsive landing page used to demonstrate Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

Run locally:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve over a local server).
2. Click the "Get Started" or the "Clicks" button to test interactive bits.

This repo is for a version-control exercise: create two branches, change the top heading in different ways to intentionally cause a merge conflict, merge one branch into main, then attempt to merge the other and resolve the conflict.
